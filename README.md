# BOGUS

A _beautifully organized generator of unintelligible stuff_!

## Why???

We all do it. Create a random string in the console to make sure our regex captures it properly, or choose a random integer to see if our upper limit check works. Or is it only me?

Anyhow, I'm tired of wasting time writing pseudo-random strings that always end up being a variant of "Hello, World!", "Hi", or even "nfjdkfnsknfsd".

With **BOGUS**, you get a simple way of generating random whatever-you-need for your whatever-this-is project.
